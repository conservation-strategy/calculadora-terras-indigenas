      "paragraph-1": "To calculate the costs of the PGTAs, the calculator establishes statistical relationships between characteristics of the Indigenous Lands, such as size, number of villages, level of threat, complexity of access, the possible investment scenarios of the activities included in the Indigenous Lands Management Plans (PGTAs), using their average implementation costs. Each activity has a formula for predicting average costs based on (i) the average historical expenses collected and analyzed from eight Indigenous Lands, and (ii) cost projections for hypothetical scenarios that consider possible changes in the characteristics of the Indigenous Lands and the investments needed for the management activities over time. With this data, , it is possible to calculate the costs according to the management plan and characteristics of the Indigenous Lands.",
      "paragraph-2": "The cost figures are based on the averages observed during data collection with Indigenous organizations and their partners. For example, if an Indigenous land spent R$1,000,000 on an activity and another land with similar characteristics spent R$2,000,000, the average cost predicted by the Calculator would be R$1,500,000. The comparison between the predicted average value and the actual value may vary (e.g. Â±R$500,000). This variation does not indicate an error in the model, it indicates that there is a difference between the cost of one organization's activity and the combined average of all the organizations. Thus, half of the forecasts will have a margin of error upwards and the other half downwards. When you add up the different activities to a total investment amount for a PGTA, this margin of error tends to cancel itself out, i.e. the total value of a PGTA investment will likely not have this margin of error."
